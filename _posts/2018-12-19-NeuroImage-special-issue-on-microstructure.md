On November 15 the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/neuroimage/vol/182">Neuroimage special issue on microstructure</a> was officially out. Two years in the making, the special issue collected 39 scientific articles by the leaders in the field. In the weeks following the special issue publication, we decided to do a social media experiment: For every paper we tweeted a brief summary and a key figure from the article. With 300+ retweets, 500+ likes and 1000+ link clicks, our social media blitz attracted significant attention from the microstructural imaging community. 100,000 Twitter impressions later, we compiled all those tweets on this page, providing readers with a unique snapshot of the state of the art in the field of microstructure circa 2019.
