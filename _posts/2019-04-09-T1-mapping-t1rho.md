title:  "Relaxometry Series: T<sub>1𝞺</sub>"

excerpt: T1 relaxation time at clinical fields (1.5 or 3 T) probes the molecular motional processes in the MHz range (e.g. 64 or 128 MHz. To measure such processes in the kHz range, while still performing the experiment at clinical fields, we can use T1𝞺 relaxation (Redfield 1955). In a T1𝞺 relaxation experiment, a spin-lock pulse, ω1, is applied

Below is a tutorial on T<sub>1𝞺</sub> mapping. Unlike our previous posts in our relaxometry series, the figures in this post are not interactive. If you would like to contribute T<sub>1𝞺</sub> mapping code as a qMRLab feature, we invite readers to fork our repo and <a href="https://github.com/qMRLab/qMRLab/issues" target="_blank">open an issue</a> or <a href="https://github.com/qMRLab/qMRLab/pulls">pull request</a> with the relevant details of your contribution!
